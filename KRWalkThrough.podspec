By including KRWalkThrough into your project, you can easily build a walk through 
without polluting your code with walk through code, which is most likely used in the
app only once.

Using TutorialManager, a singleton object that will overlay the walk through on top of
your regular views, you can control the next steps of the walk through easily.
