## Note on Swift 3 & iOS 10

For those who are using Swift 2.2-, there is a separate `swift2.2` branch. Or you can choose to checkout `0.9.7`.

For those who have migrated to Swift 3, please read the following.

There seems to be a false memory leak bug in Swift 3 & iOS 10.
What I've found out about this bug so far points me to think that this is not a real memory leak.
To find out more about this, please read this [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39886126/swift-3-ios-10-false-memory-leak-bug).
